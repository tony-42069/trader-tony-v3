# TraderTony v3 - Testnet Testing Debugging Report (2025-04-03)

## Goal

Resolve blockers preventing Testnet testing and validate core trading/position management functionality.

## Initial State

*   Testnet wallet (`AcYL...BCxL`) was funded with 6 SOL.
*   Running `prepare-testnet.js` initially failed due to `.env` configuration issues and test script errors.

## Debugging Steps & Fixes Applied

1.  **`.env` Configuration:**
    *   Updated `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` to the correct private key (`3crW...pF4x`) for the funded wallet.
    *   Corrected the environment variable name from `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` to `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` to match the variable expected by `src/utils/solana.js`.

2.  **`prepare-testnet.js` Script:**
    *   Fixed incorrect SOL balance calculation (removed redundant division by `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL`). Script now correctly reports `6.0000 SOL`.
    *   Updated the test token from an invalid address (`GfGY...2fM`) to WSOL (`So11...1112`), and later to USDC (`EPjF...Dt1v`) for more reliable testing.
    *   Corrected the check for Jupiter client initialization (removed check for non-existent `isInitialized` property).
    *   Corrected the function call for fetching token price (`getSOLPrice` -> `getTokenPrice`).
    *   *Result:* `prepare-testnet.js` now runs and reports overall success âœ….

3.  **`jupiter-client.js` (`getTokenPrice` function):**
    *   Added a specific check to return `1.0` immediately if WSOL is requested, avoiding unnecessary API calls.
    *   Refactored the price calculation logic multiple times, including prioritizing the Token -> SOL quote direction and improving decimal handling, attempting to resolve inaccurate price results (like 0.000000 for USDC).

4.  **`jupiter-test.js` Script:**
    *   Corrected the function call (`getTokenPriceInSOL` -> `getTokenPrice`).
    *   Updated the test token to WSOL, then USDC to align with `prepare-testnet.js`.
    *   Added `parseFloat` to handle `priceImpactPct` potentially being a string.
    *   Implemented stricter checks for API call success (`buyQuote.success`, `sellQuote.success`).
    *   Removed calls to a non-existent `simulateSwap` function.
    *   Fixed syntax errors introduced during previous edits.
    *   *Result:* `jupiter-test.js` now runs and reports success ðŸŽ‰, correctly fetching quotes for SOL/USDC.

5.  **`test-single-feature.js` Script:**
    *   Updated the test token address to USDC.
    *   Fixed `TypeError: autoTrader.setJupiterClient is not a function` by removing the incorrect call.
    *   Fixed `Error executing buy: Invalid token metadata` by:
        *   Fetching the current token price before calling `executeBuy`.
        *   Constructing the required `tokenMetadata` object (including `address` and `price`).
        *   Calling `autoTrader.executeBuy` with the correct arguments (`tokenMetadata`, `testStrategy`).
    *   Fixed `Error executing buy: Jupiter client not initialized` by passing the `jupiterClient` (and other required components like `tokenSniper`, `riskAnalyzer`) to the `AutoTrader` constructor.

## Current Status

*   The primary configuration issues in `.env` and the test scripts (`prepare-testnet.js`, `jupiter-test.js`) appear resolved.
*   Basic Jupiter API interaction (fetching quotes for SOL/USDC) is confirmed working via `jupiter-test.js`.
*   Attempting to run `test-single-feature.js maxHoldTime` (the first step in testing position management features) now fails during the initial buy execution.

## Current Blocking Error

*   When running `node src/testing/test-single-feature.js maxHoldTime`, the script fails with the error: `Swap execution failed: Failed to get quote: Unknown error`.
*   This error occurs within `autoTrader.executeBuy` -> `jupiterClient.executeSwap` -> `jupiterClient.getQuote`.
*   It indicates that the call to the Jupiter API's `/quote` endpoint is failing for the SOL -> USDC pair in this context, but the specific reason (e.g., invalid parameters, API issue) is being masked by the "Unknown error" message due to the current error handling in `jupiterClient.getQuote`.

## Next Logical Debugging Step (Paused)

*   Examine the `catch` block within the `getQuote` function in `src/trading/jupiter-client.js` to improve error logging and capture more specific details from the failed Axios request to the Jupiter API. This would help pinpoint why the SOL -> USDC quote request is failing in the context of the `executeBuy` function.
