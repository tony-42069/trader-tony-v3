## üöß Current Status

TraderTony v3 is now a functional trading bot with the following capabilities:
- Users can connect their Solana wallets or use demo mode
- Real-time balance and token tracking
- Actual DEX trading through Jupiter integration
- Basic risk analysis before purchasing tokens
- Deposit and withdraw using Phantom wallet
- Monitor tokens with automatic price updates

The bot has core functionality implemented, including Jupiter integration and position management logic (SL/TP, Trailing, Partials, Scale-in). 
**However, it is currently blocked during Testnet validation.** Attempts to execute test trades are failing due to errors getting quotes from Jupiter within the `executeBuy` flow. See `DEBUGGING_REPORT.md` for details.
